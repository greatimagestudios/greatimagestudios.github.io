If you’re coming via the new A555 bypass, turn left at the end of the bypass onto the A6 and first left again shortly afterwards. Follow the road you see us on the right where the ends.

The studios are located on the old A6 Buxton Road which has now been bypassed.

The road is now a ‘no through road’ but accessible for businesses.

If you’re coming from Hazel Grove on the A6, turn right on to what was the old A6 road – you’ll see signs for Simpsons Business Centre and A6 Tiles.

Note that Mill Lane is blocked off and not suitable for cars - not all satnav systems are aware of this.
