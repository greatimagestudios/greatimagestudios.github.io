If you’re coming via the new A555 bypass (you might need a dinghy in wet weather), turn left at the end of the bypass onto the A6 and first left again shortly afterwards. Follow the road you see us on the right where the ends.

The studios are located on the old A6 Buxton Road which has now been bypassed.

The road is now a ‘no through road’ but accessible for businesses.

If you’re coming from Hazel Grove on the A6, turn right on to what was the old A6 road (Buxton Rd) – you’ll see signs for Simpsons Business Centre and A6 Tiles.

If you're coming from High Lane don't take take the turning onto Buxton Rd which takes you over the A555 bridge - busses only - punishment cameras are in operation. You have been warned!

Note also that Mill Lane is blocked off to traffic, you cannot drive though it to Buxton Rd - not all satnav systems are aware of this.
