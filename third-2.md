Top quality Dynacord PA mixing desks are provided in all rooms with Peavey or Mackie Active speakers.

Shure mics are available to hire but it is recommended and preferred if you bring your own during the Covid pandemic. Hire mics are sterilised after each use.

We have bass combos, guitar combos and drum kits available to hire if you prefer to travel light.

We also stock strings, straps and sticks in case you get caught short.
